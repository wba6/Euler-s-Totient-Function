Euler's Totient Function, denoted as $φ(n)$, is a important concept that is used widely in number theory that counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. This function plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, algebra, and the study of prime numbers. Euler's function serves as important piece of Euler's Theorem, a generalization of Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $\gcd(a, n) = 1$, then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$. This theorem implications in modular arithmetic and is key to the security of widely used cryptographic algorithms such as RSA. Additionally, the totient function provides deep insights into the multiplicative structure of integers. Historically, the development of the totient function is attributed to the illustrious mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.

## Definition and Fundamental Properties

### Formal Definition

Euler's Totient Function, denoted as $\phi(n)$, is defined as the number of positive integers up to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. Formally,

$$
\phi(n) = \left| \{ k \in \mathbb{N} \mid 1 \leq k \leq n \text{ and } \gcd(k, n) = 1 \} \right|
$$

where $\gcd(k, n)$ represents the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $n$.

### Key Properties

Euler's Totient Function possesses several important properties that make it a powerful tool in number theory:

1. **Value at One:**
   $$
   \phi(1) = 1
   $$
   Since the only positive integer up to 1 is 1 itself, and it is trivially relatively prime to 1.

2. **Prime Numbers:**
   If $p$ is a prime number, then
   $$
   \phi(p) = p - 1
   $$
   This is because all positive integers less than $p$ are relatively prime to $p$.

3. **Multiplicativity:**
   Euler's Totient Function is multiplicative for coprime integers. That is, if $m$ and $n$ are two integers such that $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then
   $$
   \phi(mn) = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)
   $$

4. **Prime Powers:**
   For a prime number $p$ and a positive integer $k$,
   $$
   \phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = p^{k-1}(p - 1)
   $$
   This follows from the fact that among the first $p^k$ positive integers, exactly $p^{k-1}$ multiples of $p$ are not relatively prime to $p^k$.

5. **General Formula:**
   For any positive integer $n$ with prime factorization $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_r^{k_r}$,
   $$
   \phi(n) = n \prod_{i=1}^{r} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i}\right)
   $$
   This formula is derived from the multiplicative property and the value of $\phi$ at prime powers.

### Examples

To illustrate the computation of Euler's Totient Function, consider the following examples:

1. **Example 1: Compute $\phi(6)$**

   - Prime factorization of 6: $6 = 2 \times 3$
   - Applying the multiplicative property:
     $$
     \phi(6) = \phi(2) \cdot \phi(3) = (2 - 1) \cdot (3 - 1) = 1 \cdot 2 = 2
     $$
   - Therefore, $\phi(6) = 2$.

2. **Example 2: Compute $\phi(10)$**

   - Prime factorization of 10: $10 = 2 \times 5$
   - Applying the multiplicative property:
     $$
     \phi(10) = \phi(2) \cdot \phi(5) = (2 - 1) \cdot (5 - 1) = 1 \cdot 4 = 4
     $$
   - Therefore, $\phi(10) = 4$.

3. **Example 3: Compute $\phi(15)$**

   - Prime factorization of 15: $15 = 3 \times 5$
   - Applying the multiplicative property:
     $$
     \phi(15) = \phi(3) \cdot \phi(5) = (3 - 1) \cdot (5 - 1) = 2 \cdot 4 = 8
     $$
   - Therefore, $\phi(15) = 8$.

4. **Example 4: Compute $\phi(28)$**

   - Prime factorization of 28: $28 = 2^2 \times 7$
   - Applying the formula for prime powers and the multiplicative property:
     $$
     \phi(28) = \phi(2^2) \cdot \phi(7) = (2^2 - 2^{2-1}) \cdot (7 - 1) = (4 - 2) \cdot 6 = 2 \cdot 6 = 12
     $$
   - Therefore, $\phi(28) = 12$.

5. **Example 5: Compute $\phi(35)$**

   - Prime factorization of 35: $35 = 5 \times 7$
   - Applying the multiplicative property:
     $$
     \phi(35) = \phi(5) \cdot \phi(7) = (5 - 1) \cdot (7 - 1) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24
     $$
   - Therefore, $\phi(35) = 24$.

### Summary of Fundamental Properties

  - **Identity Element:** $\phi(1) = 1$.
  - **Prime Argument:** For prime $p$, $\phi(p) = p - 1$.
  - **Multiplicative Function:** If $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then $\phi(mn) = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)$.
  - **Prime Power:** For prime $p$ and integer $k \geq 1$, $\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$.
  - **Euler's Product Formula:** For $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_r^{k_r}$,
  $$
  \phi(n) = n \prod_{i=1}^{r} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i}\right)
  $$

These properties not only facilitate the computation of $\phi(n)$ for various integers but also lay the groundwork for deeper explorations into number theory and its applications.

## Applications in Cryptography

#### RSA Encryption
RSA encryption is a widely used encryption system based on public-key cryptography, which allows for secure data transmission between two parties. RSA is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

**How it works**:
In RSA, each user has two keys:
1. **A public key** which is used to encrypt messages and can be shared openly.
2. **A private key** which is used to decrypt messages and is kept secret.

These keys are generated as follows:
1. Choose two large prime numbers, $p$ and $q$, and calculate their product, $n = p * q$. The value $n$ is part of the public key.
2. Compute Euler's Totient Function, $\phi(n)$. In RSA, $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$, since $n$ is the product of two primes.

**Role of Euler's Totient Function in RSA**:
Euler's Totient Function is crucial in RSA because it helps in choosing an encryption exponent $e$ and in calculating the decryption exponent $d$.

1. **Choosing the encryption exponent $e$** : The encryption exponent $e$ must be a number that is relatively prime to $\phi(n)$ (i.e. gcd($e,\phi(n)) = 1$). This ensures that $e$ has a modular inverse with respect to $\phi(n)$, which allows for decryption to be possible.
2. **Calculating the decryption exponent $d$** : The decryption exponent $d$ is the modular inverse of $e$ with respect to $\phi(n)$. This means $d$ is chosen such that $e * d \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)$. The private key consists of the values $d$ and $n$, which allows the original message to be decrypted.

**Euler's Totient Function Importance**:
Euler's Totient Function makes RSA secure because finding $\phi(n)$ without knowing the prime factors of $n$ ($p$ and $q$) is challenging. The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Since $\phi(n)$ depends on the prime factors, anyone without $p$ and $q$ can't easily determine $\phi(n)$, and therefore can't calculate the decryption key, $d$.
